    "The bank faces a challenge in converting its liability-based customers (depositors) into personal loan customers. To address this, the bank aims to develop a model that can effectively identify potential loan customers, thereby increasing the success rate of loan campaigns and reducing costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Project Details**\n",
    "**Problem**: Identifying potential personal loan customers from the bank's existing liability-based customer base.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data**: A dataset containing information on 5000 customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal**: Develop a predictive model that can accurately classify customers as potential loan customers or not. This model will help the bank target its loan campaigns more effectively, leading to increased loan business and higher profitability.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Potential Approach**\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Data Exploration**: Analyze the dataset to understand the characteristics of the customers, including demographics, financial behavior, and other relevant factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Feature Engineering**: Create new features or transform existing features to improve the model's predictive power.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Model Selection**: Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms for classification, such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, or gradient boosting.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Model Training**: Train the selected models on the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. Model Deployment**: Deploy the best-performing model into production to assist the bank in identifying potential loan customers.\n",
